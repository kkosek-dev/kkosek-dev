üü• I am a digital engineer interested in uncovering the untold stories of immense data stores using technologies at the frontier of innovation. All coding projects are built from the ground up, designed to meaningfully extract, transform and load raw data into extremely user-friendly dashboards meant for clear and coherent data analysis. As I continue my journey into data science, I am very passionate about learning skills from all over the world of tech to augment the value of my data analytics projects and technical goals. <strong>Thanks for stopping by!</strong>

 <summary><h3>üë®‚Äçüíª Karson's Coding Journey</h3></summary>
   I started my coding journey as a naive psychology student working in a research lab at the University of Tennessee in search of a passion that would be both fulfilling for me and challenging enough to sustain my interest. In college, I thought that passion was bound to be in Academia, so I devoted 3 years of my college experience to the pursuit of empirical psychology research and academic thought. In this pursuit, I self-taught myself very basic R programming logic to manipulate clinical research data and draw conclusions based on the findings. It was not until the end of my undergraduate career where I began to realize I was more passionate about the challenge data analytics itself presented rather than rigorous scientific study. Don't get me wrong, I am still very passionate about psychology as a science, but the projects I found myself looking forward to progressed towards the ones that the other students did not want to do because they involved coding and manipulation of data. I gravitated toward that challenge until I realized it was a more fulfilling pursuit for me as a whole. Thus, when I graduated from the university in May of 2023, I enrolled in the Vanderbilt University Data Analytics and Visualization Bootcamp to build a strong foundation in the languages, tools & concepts employed by professional data scientists on a regular basis. I am thrilled with this decision as I continue to progress in my digital engineering journey and look to completing the Bootcamp in March of 2024 and am beyond enthused for the professional opportunities to come!
