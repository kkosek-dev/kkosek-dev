üü• Versatile analyst interested in uniting a plethora of data science tools with refined customer service skills, hungry to augment process value for an organization as well as my own professional development in the business setting. Proven knack for seeing trends in raw data and utilizing statistical findings to better inform holistic decisions. Passionate about staying at the frontier of developing data technologies to better advise operational decisions that directly affect individuals and their lives.

My goal in data science is optimizing accurate insights pulled from data near-automatically, so as to understand data in real time. To me, this represents the epitome of applying computers to the study of human behavior. Thus, I am fascinated by GenAI, in particular LLMs and their production use-cases, from an intelligence point-of-view. It is difficult to trust a transformer model trained on an unfathomably large dataset when we already know that machine learning algorithms, such as the transformer, have never been 100% accurate. Yet, doing this creates a very ‚Äúintelligent‚Äù piece of software, so I have become deeply interested in studying what sets this technological breakthrough apart.

 <summary><h3>üë®‚Äçüíª Karson's Coding Journey</h3></summary>
   I started my coding journey as a naive psychology student working in a research lab at the University of Tennessee in search of a passion that would be both fulfilling for me and challenging enough to sustain my interest. In college, I thought that passion was bound to be in Academia, so I devoted 3 years of my college experience to the pursuit of empirical psychology research and academic thought. In this pursuit, I self-taught myself very basic R programming logic to manipulate clinical research data and draw conclusions based on the findings. It was not until the end of my undergraduate career where I began to realize I was more passionate about the challenge data analytics itself presented rather than rigorous scientific study. Don't get me wrong, I am still very passionate about psychology as a science, but the projects I found myself looking forward to progressed towards the ones that the other students did not want to do because they involved coding and manipulation of data. I gravitated toward that challenge until I realized it was a more fulfilling pursuit for me as a whole. Thus, when I graduated from the university in May of 2023, I enrolled in the Vanderbilt University Data Analytics and Visualization Bootcamp to build a strong foundation in the languages, tools & concepts employed by professional data scientists on a regular basis. I am thrilled with this decision as I continue to progress in my digital engineering journey and look to completing the Bootcamp in March of 2024 and am beyond enthused for the professional opportunities to come!
